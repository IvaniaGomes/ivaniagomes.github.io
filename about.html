            <h3>Hi! I'm Ivania Gomes, a student in audiovisual communications with a love for anything arts-related.</h3>
            <br>
            <br>

            <p>It all started back in 6th grade when due to the stressful situation I found myself in, visual arts became my refuge, especially drawing and sketching. At this point, I wasn't very good at all, but I've always had lots of creativity and, even though I had very limited drawing skills, I managed to get my ideas and feelings across, which was something I hadn't yet been able to do. And so began a long and exciting journey towards learning how to reproduce an image from mere thoughts or observations.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I spent the next year and a half addicted to art, to the point where if I wasn’t in school or sleeping, I'd be drawing. And so, when the time came to choose and apply for high school, I began, of course, looking for an art school. This is when I found out about Rosedale Heights School of the Arts, the most amazing school I’ve ever been to and one that provided me with experiences and friends that I'll forever be thankful for. </p>
            <br>
            <p>This wasn't your ordinary arts high school where you have to major in a specific area the whole four years, here you got to experiment as much as you'd like. With a mandatory minimum of two art courses per year, I got the chance to apply my creativity in various areas, such as dance, theatre, vocal music, and of course visual art. This was a dream come true, because I have always loved singing and acting, but never had the chance to get proper training. Long story short, Rosedale offered me a safe place to explore, learn and grow both as a person and as an artist.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Things were looking great up until the end of grade 10 when my family decided to move back to Portugal. Having been used to the chaos and busy city that is Toronto, I felt completely out of my element when I was forced to live in the peaceful countryside, where I didn't know practically anyone, people weren't nearly as open-minded, and of course, there was barely any public transportation. Therefore I felt like all of my freedom was taken away, and was left stranded on a deserted island with no one to turn to.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To make matters worse, the high school I began attending was nothing like Rosedale, the environment was cold and unwelcoming, the people were small-minded and judgemental, and the regular art course they offered was extremely plain. This was my life for the next two months, up until I found a better alternative- IAI. Without hesitation, I enrolled in the specialised art course, Imagem Interativa, offered at Instituto das Arts e da Imagem. Everything began looking great, my classmates were super fun and much similar to my old schoolmates and friends, the course was a lot more intense and hands-on, and not to mention, it was in the city of Porto! After what seemed like an eternity, Portugal finally felt somewhat like home, the only downside being the school is a two-hour ride from my home. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I’ve been in IAI for about three years, this current one being my last, I have gained tremendous knowledge about the world of art, made lifelong friendships and acquired new perspectives on life and my future.
            <br>
            <p>In this portfolio, you’ll find the aftermath of this long story - my most beloved works. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it. :)</p>
